A major benefit of ephemeral environments is how convenient they make sharing and collaborating across your team.

## Cross-Team Communications
Since ephemeral environments are lightweight and easily shareable, they simplify cross-team communications, resulting in a faster, smoother dev pipeline.

### Developer to Developer
- during code reviews, developers may need to tear down their local environments in order to build another dev's environment
- with ephemeral environments, developers can run the code and feature branches entirely in an environment without destroying their local environment

### Developer to Product
- when developers create a feature, they'll want to run it past someone on the product team
- they can do this through a call or screenshare
- however, that won't allow the product team member to interact with the app
- with ephemeral environments, developers can send the product person a direct link to the WIP environment
- product can provide relevant, full-scope feedback

### Developer to QA
- after a feature passes a code review, QA can immediately interact with the new feature and provide feedback
- QA can find problems and bugs early on, prior to a merge, so the devs can quickly address and fix accordingly

### Developer to Customer
- if a customer has a certain app in mind and requests a demo, developers can build a sample app and send them a link to a live ephemeral environment
- customers can interact with their app and get a sense of its appearance and approximate performance
